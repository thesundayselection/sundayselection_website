**Jay-U Experience - Enough Is Enough**

We start this week’s Sunday Service with a taste of the 1970s Nigerian funk-rock scene and the sounds of Jay-U Experience. His 1977 debut album, ‘Enough is Enough’, is a 5-track medley which jumps from leisurely reggae-pop to jazzy afrobeat to heavy psychedelic rock. The title track is a 6-minute jazz-funk fusion with a catchy guitar riff and healthy dose of saxophone solos.

**Toko and Naoussi - Fly No More**  

Next up is an 80s Nigerian disco boogie hit by Toko and Naoussi from their rare LP, Happy Day To U. The album was produced by Jake Sollo, one of the most prolific musicians from Nigeria in the 70s and 80s. Sollo’s distinctive producing style and use of synthesizers made him popular for “bouncy, high gloss boogie” which ‘Fly No More’ is no exception.

**Ti Celeste - Population Basse-Terrienne Aux Abois**

While Ti Celeste (Guadalupe) might be the only non-African artist in the selection, the penultimate track from his 1976 album, ‘La Beauté Du Folklore’, doesn’t feel out of place. ‘Population Basse-Terrienne Aux Abois’ is a catchy call and response percussion chant with its roots firmly in the Afro-Caribbean world.

**Amazones De Guinée - Samba**

Les Amazones De Guinée were the country’s first all-female group formed by members of Guinean army in 1961. Guinea’s first post-colonial president, Sekou Toure, implemented a cultural policy of ‘authenticite’, which forced bands to play regional music and reject popular French and American influences. Les Amazones were one of the state-supported groups under Toure’s reign. Their high-energy live performances booked them shows across the continent, and in 1983 they finally travelled to Paris to record their first LP, ‘Au Coeur De Paris’.

**Gyedu Blay Ambolley - Highlife**

Moving west across Africa to Ghana now, and the home of our next artist. Gyedu Blay Ambolley is one of the pioneers of Ghana’s highlife scene along with Ebo Taylor, and the inventor of the ‘Simigwa’ genre. “Highlife”, from his “Cut Your Coat” LP, fuses elements of afrobeat, calypso, disco and funk, and embodies Ambolley’s vision of highlife music.

**Boncana Maïga - Koyma Hondo**

Boncana Maïga was a founder of Les Maravillas du Mali, a group of Malian musicians who traveled to Havana to study Cuban music in the sixties before bringing their fusion sounds to the world. Hot Casa recently released a selection of Maïga’s songs from 1978–1982 including the two afro-funk tracks ‘Yala M’Le’ and ‘Koyma Hondo’.

**Fela Kuti - Trouble Sleep Yanga Wake AM**

No afro-inspired mix would be complete without the king of afrobeat himself. ‘Trouble Sleep Yanga Wake Am’ is a 12-minute spiritual journey that you never want to end.
