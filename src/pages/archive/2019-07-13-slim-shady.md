**Jay-U Experience - Enough Is Enough**

We start this week’s Sunday Service with a taste of the 1970s Nigerian funk-rock scene and the sounds of Jay-U Experience. His 1977 debut album, ‘Enough is Enough’, is a 5-track medley which jumps from leisurely reggae-pop to jazzy afrobeat to heavy psychedelic rock. The title track is a 6-minute jazz-funk fusion with a catchy guitar riff and healthy dose of saxophone solos.

**Toko and Naoussi - Fly No More**  

Next up is an 80s Nigerian disco boogie hit by Toko and Naoussi from their rare LP, Happy Day To U. The album was produced by Jake Sollo, one of the most prolific musicians from Nigeria in the 70s and 80s. Sollo’s distinctive producing style and use of synthesizers made him popular for “bouncy, high gloss boogie” which ‘Fly No More’ is no exception.

**Ti Celeste - Population Basse-Terrienne Aux Abois**

While Ti Celeste (Guadalupe) might be the only non-African artist in the selection, the penultimate track from his 1976 album, ‘La Beauté Du Folklore’, doesn’t feel out of place. ‘Population Basse-Terrienne Aux Abois’ is a catchy call and response percussion chant with its roots firmly in the Afro-Caribbean world.
