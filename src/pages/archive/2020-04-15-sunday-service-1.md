**Jay-U Experience - Enough Is Enough**

We start this week’s Sunday Service with a taste of the 1970s Nigerian funk-rock scene and the sounds of Jay-U Experience. His 1977 debut album, ‘Enough is Enough’, is a 5-track medley which jumps from leisurely reggae-pop to jazzy afrobeat to heavy psychedelic rock. The title track is a 6-minute jazz-funk fusion with a catchy guitar riff and healthy dose of saxophone solos.
